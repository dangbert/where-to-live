some possible helper texts for the drop down menus. Since we are giving the information in
  detail when the pin is hovered over, minimal numbers and just a concise description should do.

Public Schools: Select schooling level(s) that are important; an upper percentile of all schools 
  of that education will be selected.
  
Public Transportation: Select the availability of public transport, compared to other neighborhoods
  across the nation.
  
Crime: Select an acceptable amount of crime compared to other neighborhoods across the nation. High Crime
  Rate areas are not availible.

  a general list of parks and rec areas will be used.
  
Climate: Select a preferred tempature, rainfall, and snowfall for search.

Health Care: Select quality of Health Care, based on the availbility of doctors for both general practice and
  specialized care. A higher number of doctors indicates a higher quality of care.

  (hour or longer commute). Shorter commute times will also be included.
  
That's what I can think of off the top of my head, feel free to tailor these as needed.
